                                    A variable is a named container for storing data values. You can think of it as a

                                    JavaScript is a <b>dynamically</b> typed language, which means that variables are
                                    not
                                    explicitly declared with data types. Instead, JavaScript determines the data type of
                                    a variable based on the value it holds. There are several primary data types in
                                    JavaScript, which can be categorized into two main categories: <b>Primitive
                                        data-types</b> and <b>Reference/Non-primitive data-types</b>.

                                            <b>Primitive data-types:</b> In JavaScript are the basic building blocks for
                                            storing
                                            and manipulating simple values. They are immutable, meaning their values
                                            cannot be
                                            changed once they are assigned. JavaScript has six primitive data types,
                                            <b>Number,String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt,</b> These
                                            primitive data
                                            types are used to store and manipulate simple values in JavaScript. They are
                                            passed
                                            by value, meaning when you assign a primitive data type to a variable or
                                            pass it as
                                            an argument to a function, you are working with a copy of the actual value.
                                            This
                                            copy is independent of the original value, and changes made to one do not
                                            affect the
                                            other.

                                            can hold and manipulate collections of values, objects, or functions. Unlike
                                            primitive data types, non-primitive data types are mutable, meaning their
                                            values can
                                            be changed after they are created. JavaScript has four main non-primitive

                                            <b>var</b> is the oldest way to declare variables in JavaScript, and it has
                                            global or function-level scope, depending on where it is declared.
                                            Variables declared with <b>var</b> are hoisted, which means they are moved
                                            to the top of their containing function or global scope during execution.
                                            <b>var</b> variables can be redeclared within the same scope without any
                                            errors.
                                            Generally, <b>var</b> is less commonly used in modern JavaScript due to its
                                            quirks and limitations. It's still found in older codebases.

                                            <b>let</b> was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and has block-level scope,
                                            which means it is limited to the block
                                            (enclosed by curly braces) where it's declared.
                                            Variables declared with <b>let</b> are also hoisted but are not initialized
                                            until the point where they are declared.
                                            Unlike var, <b>let</b> does not allow redeclaration of variables in the same
                                            scope.

                                            let.
                                            Variables declared with <b>const</b> cannot be reassigned after their
                                            initial assignment. However, it's important to note that the value they hold
                                            may still be mutable (e.g., if it's an object or array, you can modify its

                                            <b>Hoisting</b> is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function
                                            declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the
                                            compilation phase before the code is executed. This means that, regardless
                                            of where a variable or function is declared within its scope, it is
                                            conceptually moved to the top, allowing you to use it before it's formally
                                            declared in your code.

                                            However, it's important to understand that hoisting only moves the
                                            declarations, not the initializations (assigning a value to a variable).
                                            Let's break down hoisting for both variables and functions:

                                                        the declaration is hoisted to the top of its containing function
                                                        or global scope, but the initialization remains in place.

                                            It's important to note that hoisting occurs differently for <b>var</b>,
                                            <b>let</b>, and <b>const</b> declarations: <br>

                                            Variables declared with <b>var</b> are hoisted and initialized with
                                            <b>undefined</b>. <br>
                                            Variables declared with <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> are hoisted but remain
                                            uninitialized (in a "temporal dead zone") until
                                            their actual declaration in the code. Attempting to access them before their
                                            declaration results in a
                                            <b>ReferenceError</b>. <br>
                                            Understanding hoisting is crucial for writing reliable JavaScript code. It's
                                            a good practice to declare your
                                            variables and functions at the beginning of their respective scopes to make
                                            your code more predictable and
                                            maintainable, even if they are technically hoisted by the JavaScript engine.

                                            JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables are
                                            not explicitly declared with data types. Instead, JavaScript determines the
                                            data type of a variable based on the value it holds. There are several
                                            primary data types in JavaScript, which can be categorized into two main
                                            categories: <b>Primitive data-types</b> and <b>Reference/Non-primitive

                                            <b>Primitive data-types:</b> in JavaScript are the basic building
                                            blocks for storing and manipulating simple values. They are
                                            immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are
                                            assigned. JavaScript has six primitive data types, <b>Number,String,

                                            JavaScript. They are passed by value, meaning when you assign a
                                            primitive data type to a variable or pass it as an argument to a
                                            function, you are working with a copy of the actual value. This copy
                                            is independent of the original value, and changes made to one do not
                                            affect the other.
